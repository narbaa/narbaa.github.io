        <h2>3/11 update:</h2>
        <p>life is still being sucky. i need to keep trying to figure out what i want to do. i got a little depressed after looking at <a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/">this calculator</a> while thinking about my dream of living in manhattan after college. every day it seems less and less possible.</p>
        <p>oh the naivete of younger me. anyway here's to hoping i figure it out soon enough, day by day, step by step! i have a guilty pleasure for life hacks, so not having the hard and fast answer to what i want to do in the future is frustrating me to no end. not only that, i feel like i have no marketable skills.</p>
        <p>someone call a wah-mbulance!</p>
